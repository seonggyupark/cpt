Main place of delivery: The tasks will be performed on the contractor's premises and the deposit boxes arrangement will be installed inside the Commission's Euroforum office building in L-Luxembourg.
II.1.3) The notice involves:
A public contract.
II.1.5) Short description of the contract or purchase(s):
The European Commission Directorate-General for Energy and Transport would like to purchase an arrangement consisting of about 240 individual letterbox-type small lockers.
Each locker should be locked by an individual key or by an electronic system. In order to have access to all of these individual lockers at the time, there should be a possibility to open a group of lockers together in 1 action. Therefore, an even number of the small doors for the individual lockers shall be mounted in a larger door frame. It should be possible to open this door frame in order to give direct access to the small lockers behind. Since the installation will stand against the wall, this common opening must be done to the front of the installation.
The items to be stored in each of the small lockers are 1 standard EU passport sized document and 2 items of about a mobile phone size. Therefore, the inside dimension of each locker should be in the order of 18 cm wide, 20 to 25 cm deep and between 6 and 8 cm high.
Each locker should be individually closed and locked. The opening may be done by an individual key or electronically from a central control unit by introducing an individual code number. In case of a key system each locker door shall show an engraved running number.
There should be a drawer in each of the lockers with a possibility to attach a label at the front.
The installation should be separated into 2 blocks with half the number of the lockers in each arrangement. The outside dimension should not exceed the length of 2,20 metre each. The lower row of lockers should be about 60 cm from ground level and the upper row should be not more than 160 cm above ground level. Therefore, the installation should stand on a rack-type support. The installation will be placed inside the building on PVC-covered concrete floor and only fixed against a concrete wall.
Ñ The side walls of the whole installation may be painted (RAL colour to be defined) but the individual lockers' front doors should be made of polished or brushed metal surface. Since the installation is under permanent surveillance, there are no specific safety requirements but the lockers should be burglar-proof against the use of normal housebreaking tools. As a supplement to this locker installation, 2 deposit safes should be delivered which allow depositing a large number of the above-described items in each of these safes. The 2 safes should stand beside each of the locker arrangements.
